## Problem Statement Breakdown

Information in the form of digital data has become the foundation on which our US National Security, DOD Commands and IC Agencies base their decisions. The proper collection, analysis, and usability of timely, accurate and relevant data can mean the difference between mission success and failure.

### The Data Deluge Challenge

Today new sources and types has created a data deluge that grows exponentially each day.

**Data Types Include:**
- Text
- Images  
- Video
- Signals
- Hard Media

**Data Sources:**
- Commercial Assets
- Government Sources
- Open Source Data

### Core Problems Identified

#### Problem #1 - Data Access Bottleneck
The National Security, IC and DOD are not able access the right data at the right time to perform exploitation/analysis to make correct decisions.

*Data Management is a continual, growing and unsolved problem area*

#### Problem #2 - Processing Inefficiencies  
Data processing (extracting, Securing, maintaining, transferring, and loading data) is ineffective, inefficient and costly, taking valuable time and resources away from analyzing and pulling value from the data.

*Data Management is a growing cost driver with diminishing value/ROI*

### The Processing Burden
The current data workflow involves multiple layers of processing:
- **Data Extraction** 
- **Data Security**
- **Data Transfer** 
- **Data Load**

**Critical Issue**: More time and money is spent processing data than using and extracting value from data.

## ANSER Technology Overview

ANSER is purpose built to fit into any existing enterprise or data ecosystem as the central point that connects the data sources/suppliers, data libraries/storage, software/tools and data users/consumers. ANSER matures any data management environment providing insight into the entire data supply chain.

### Core ANSER Principles

#### Strategy
ANSER is meant to serve as the central point between the four elements in any data ecosystem, the Data Sources, Data Libraries, Tools/Software, and Data Users. With ANSER the end-to-end data supply chain comes into focus and data management matures.

#### System  
ANSER is fully cloud native, security compliant to work within all IC/DOD domains, and designed in the around an Open-Source Software baseline, open API standards, micro services and open interfaces making it able to integrate seamlessly into any enterprise or data ecosystem.

#### Solution
ANSER enhances and matures any data ecosystem by ensuring all data holdings regardless of type are accessible, secure, compliant, complete, accurate and able to consumed by any authorized users including machine to machine AI/ML.

### Key Value Proposition
**Data management maturity is the key to extracting value from data**

### ANSER Addresses Critical Questions

- Where is my data?
- Who is using my data?
- What data is being consumed most?
- What data is being consumed least?
- What data is never consumed?
- Who is providing me good data?
- Who is providing me bad data?
- How much storing my data cost?
- How much does processing my data cost?
- How many copies of data do I have?
- Who is the most active consumer of data?
- Who is the least active consumer of data?
- When is my data being consumed?
- How is my data being consumed?

## ANSER Ensures Data Provides Value

ANSER provides a clear path to data management maturity ensuring data is not a burden ensures and the value of an organizations data is maximized. Comprised of five core elements, ANSER enhances and automates the data processes that needlessly consume resources, time and money preventing data from providing true value and positive impact on mission.

### Five Core Capabilities

#### 1. Access Data
**Ensures full access to all data holdings**

ANSER continually and automatically extracts and indexes all metadata from all content provide a single Data Catalog that maintains and tracks all data across all content holdings. Using PKI enabled FGAC, RBAC and ABAC, ANSER ensures all content is discoverable, editable and retrievable in compliance with an organizations Identify and Access Management (ICAM) policies and guidelines.

#### 2. Secure Data  
**Ensures all data is properly classified and secure**

Immediately upon data ingest all data is automatically security tagged and labeled with the proper classification at the product, file, object and attribute level before any user or machine sees it or is able to interact with the content. This preemptive classification aligns with the US Federal security directives and National Security, IC and DOD classification guidelines.

**Security Classifications:**
- Top Secret
- Secret  
- Confidential
- Unclassified

#### 3. Complete Data
**Ensures of all data is correct and compliant with all data standards**

Data Conditioners automatically correct, normalize, standardize, and tag all data to compile with organizational data standards whether those or custom built or MILSPEC, ISO, OGC, NSG, etc.

#### 4. Accurate Data
**Ensures the most accurate data through the merging of**

Automated data extraction and conditioning merges the best attributes from multiple data source into a singular most accurate version of truth.

#### 5. AI/ML Integration
**Enables AI/ML Integration**

Cloud native, Open-Source Software baseline, open API standards, micro services seamlessly integrates with any AI/ML mission systems.
