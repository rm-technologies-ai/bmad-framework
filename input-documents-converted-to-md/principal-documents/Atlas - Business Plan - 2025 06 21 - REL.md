## Go-To-Market Strategy

Atlas-DS is positioned to address critical public and private sector data challenges through a targeted go-to-market strategy.

### Market Tailwinds

#### Race to Incorporate AI/ML Capabilities
As public and private sector organizations accelerate efforts to adopt AI/ML as a strategic force multiplier, the demand for high-quality, well-governed data solutions is growing rapidly. This shift creates a significant market tailwind for Atlas-DS, which is purpose-built to enable AI/ML by transforming raw, structured, and unstructured data into a discoverable catalog than can enable trusted, actionable insights.

#### Public Sector Procurement to Favor COTS Products
Executive Order (04/16/25) codified the importance of COTS Products in government procurement decisions. The Atlas-DS platform is just that – a flexible, malleable product that can be quickly procured and seamlessly implemented into operations.

*"It is the policy of my Administration that agencies shall procure commercially available products and services, including those that can be modified to fill agencies' needs, to the maximum extent practicable, including pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994."*

#### Atlas-DS Aligns with Administration's Strategic Priorities
The current Administration is keen to advance its position on three key areas – the Southwest Border, Cartels, and China. The Atlas-DS platform, and its legacy product, have already provided strategic, mission-forward value in these areas. The recent expansion from 50 to 500+ users relates to Treasury and Law Enforcement efforts that directly supports two of the Administration's priorities.

#### Data-Driven Decisions
Public and private sectors shift toward leveraging big data-driven decision-making, fueled by the rapid expansion of data sets. As organization rely more heavily on large, diverse, and fast-evolving datasets to support critical functions – from supply chains and finance to national security and healthcare – the need for platforms that can seamlessly unify, govern, and derive actionable insights from complex data is growing.

### Market Headwinds
**Massive Federal Organizational Realignments**: A significant IC/DOD and Federal market headwind relates to DOGE efforts, which has altered budgets, created mass exodus of Federal employees and has prompted agency, directorate, office and organizational restructuring.

### Go-To-Market Best Practices Framework

1. **Market Analysis & Segmentation**

- **Standard Maintenance**: Includes security patches, bug fixes, minor upgrades, and remote helpdesk support at no extra cost

#### Monthly Subscription
**$1.25MM - $2.5MM per year**
- **Subscription Model**: Monthly subscription price remains fixed for the lifetime of the purchased Atlas version. New versions may come with updated pricing
- **Primary Benefit**: Lower upfront cost encourages adoption by reducing financial barriers
- **Primary Risk**: Higher cancellation risk unless mitigated by an "annual commitment billed monthly" clause in the terms of service
- **License Management**: Regular audits recommended to identify and adjust for usage overruns
- **Standard Maintenance**: Includes security patches, bug fixes, minor upgrades, and remote helpdesk support at no extra cost

### Professional Services Pricing Model

#### Software Specialists
**$200 - $400K per FTE per year**

This service option will provide onsite or remote professional services (either uncleared or cleared) technical support under three primary job functions:

1. **Trainer**: Delivers training on Atlas usage and administration to customer resources
2. **System Administrator**: Manages Atlas within the customer environment, reducing reliance on internal IT resources  
3. **System Engineer / Developer**: Provides customization, integration, and engineering to tailor Atlas to specific customer needs and outcomes

Travel and other direct costs (ODC's) will be billed at cost plus fee (8%).

**Strategic Note**: The productization of Atlas-DS will require client-side deployment, integration, and sustainment professional services support which will be provided by Freedom. The team anticipates the Professional Services tail to be larger, and longer, than the software licensing fees.

## Deal Structure

Atlas Data Science will initially operate as an affiliate of FTSG with its own P&L; however, the intent is for Atlas to spin out of FTSG into a standalone entity. Investor funding into the entity will be in the form of a convertible note, providing the potential to invest up to $5.0MM – at a Pre-Money Valuation of $4.0MM.

### Investment Structure
- **Pre Money Valuation**: $4,000,000
- **Initial Funding**: $3.0MM from Investors
- **Incremental Funding**: $2.0MM opportunity (not obligation) at same valuation
- **Total Potential Investment**: $5.0MM

### Cap Table Structure

**After Initial Funding:**
- FTSG: $4,000,000 (57.1%)
- Investors: $3,000,000 (42.9%)
- **Total**: $7,000,000 (100.0%)

**After Incremental Funding:**
- FTSG: $4,000,000 (44.4%)
- Investors: $5,000,000 (55.6%)
- **Total**: $9,000,000 (100.0%)

### Value Creation Paths

This structure provides flexibility for growth while setting a clear path for independence of the new business. The two potential paths for value creation are:

#### Spin-Out as a Separate Entity
If substantial commercial and private-sector opportunities are realized, the Atlas Data Science will be fully spun out into its own entity and Investor Funding will convert on a pro rata basis. This path unlocks the potential for external funding rounds, allowing investors to participate in the broader value creation through a future sale of the Freedom AI entity.

#### Integration Within FTSG
If Atlas Data Science demonstrates strong growth within the government space and its synergies significantly enhance FTSG's strategic position – and associated valuation - the business can potentially remain within Freedom. The invested capital would then convert into Freedom equity at **9.0x 2024 EBITDA**, providing clear value creation through multiple enhancement.

### Corporate Structure
- **WDG AI** → **Atlas Data Science** (receives $3.0MM Initial Funding and Knowledge and Resources)
- **Telcom** → **FTSG** (provides Knowledge and Resources to Atlas Data Science)

Atlas will initially operate as a subsidiary/affiliate of FTSG, leveraging FTSG's technical knowledge base and HR resources to launch.

## Deal Merits

Investors have committed up to $5MM of capital in developing and launching Atlas Data Science. Key deal merits including an attractive pre-money valuation, robust downside protection, a proven government-funded predecessor product, and a secure, scalable platform designed serve mission-critical data needs.

### Investment Highlights

✓ **Attractive Entry Price**: $4MM pre-money, which is a below market seed deal, particularly for software

✓ **Considerable Amount Spent in Development**: the government has already spent $40MM+ in development of a predecessor solution

✓ **Potential to Reduce Development Expense**: flexibility in reducing development expenses by swapping cash bonuses in favor of options

✓ **Deep Expertise with Potential Customers**: pipeline development underway with Freedom, who are deeply familiar with the market. Atlas-DS is targeting the NGA for pilot deployment, a relationship that is already well underway

✓ **Convertible Note Coupon**: 8% interest per annum, almost double the the risk-free rate of return

✓ **Management Option Pool Worthless in the Event of No Spin**: options are worthless if Atlas is subsumed into FTSG, so investors aren't relinquishing any equity value

✓ **Strong Downside Protection**: structure shields investors by converting into FTSG equity at 9x 2024 EBITDA. This investment will not go to $0 - investors can't lose as opposed to typical venture investments
