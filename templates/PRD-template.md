## DOCUMENT PROCESSING WORKFLOW FOR ATLAS-DS

### Phase 1: Document Classification & Initial Extraction
1. **Identify document type** (business plan, technical spec, security requirement, etc.)
2. **Map content to relevant PRD sections** using this classification guide
3. **Extract key information** preserving source attribution
4. **Flag missing sections** for follow-up document requests

### Phase 2: Content Aggregation & Synthesis  
1. **Aggregate similar content** across multiple source documents
2. **Resolve conflicts** between source documents with business stakeholder input
3. **Identify gaps** where additional research or clarification needed
4. **Maintain traceability** to source documents for audit purposes

### Phase 3: PRD Section Population
1. **Populate PRD sections** systematically using aggregated content
2. **Ensure SMART acceptance criteria** for all functional requirements
3. **Validate NFRs** against industry benchmarks and project constraints
4. **Review for completeness** against this classification framework
