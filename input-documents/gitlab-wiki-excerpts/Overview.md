# Project Lion Overview

## Our Vision & Mission
Project Lion will provide the foundational cloud‑native data‑management and governance platform.

**North-Star Vision (from technical discussions):**
Project Lion is envisioned as a **unified data‑governance hub**. The focus is on cataloguing, tagging, lineage, and policy enforcement, leaving raw storage in the customer’s cloud account. Geospatial support is a key differentiator.

## Executive Summary & Goals

Project Lion is being developed to productize a secure, cloud‑native data‑management and governance platform.
*   **MVP Target:** December 2025
*   **Version 1.0 Release Target:** March 2026
*   **Initial Focus:** Geospatial‑intelligence (GEOINT).
*   **Future Expansion:** Other business sectors.

## Core Product Features

Project Lion will deliver capabilities across several key categories:

**1. Centralized Data Hub:**
    *   Flexible ingestion framework
    *   Rich metadata catalog
    *   Data‑quality services

**2. Data Accessibility:**
    *   Lineage tracking
    *   Intuitive discovery UI
    *   Data Owners, Data users, and admin tooling

**3. Security & Compliance:**
    *   Role‑based access control (RBAC)
    *   Policy enforcement ( leveraging OPA - Open Policy Agent)
    *   Industry and federal compliance support (e.g., SOC2, FedRAMP path when needed)

**MVP Feature Set:**
*   **Connector Kit:** S3 event listener (pilot), JDBC puller.
*   **Catalog Core:** Dataset & asset entities, schema explorer, lineage graph.
*   **Policy Engine:** RBAC + attribute‑based tags.
*   **Search & UI:** Full‑text + faceted filters, React/Next front‑end.
*   **Metrics:** Cost & usage dashboards.
