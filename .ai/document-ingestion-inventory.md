## BMad Agent Processing Recommendations

### Primary Analysis Priorities
1. **Business Requirements Extraction** - Use business plan and personas for PRD foundation
2. **Technical Architecture Validation** - Cross-reference tech stack with implementation specs  
3. **Component Integration Analysis** - Validate API contracts and event flows between services
4. **Security Model Review** - Ensure multi-tenant isolation and policy enforcement consistency
5. **Implementation Planning** - Convert epics/issues into development stories with security controls
6. **ATO Compliance Mapping** - Align security requirements with component implementations

### Document Dependencies
- **Business Plan** → drives all technical requirements and funding timeline
- **Architecture Specs** → inform component design decisions and system integration
- **GitLab Wiki** → provides implementation-ready specifications and component APIs
- **Security Requirements** → enforce NIST 800-53 controls and ATO compliance
- **Epics/Issues** → detailed implementation tasks with acceptance criteria  
- **Personas** → validate UI/UX requirements against technical capabilities

### Ready for Agent Processing: ✅
All documents successfully ingested and validated. BMad agents can now process this comprehensive documentation set for requirements analysis, architecture validation, and development story creation.
