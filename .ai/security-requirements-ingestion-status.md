## Security Requirements Content Overview

### 1. Classification Methodology (✅ Ready)
**File:** `Security Requirements Classification Methodolofy.md`
- **Content:** Three-level security control classification system
- **Purpose:** NIST 800-53 Rev 5 moderate baseline implementation framework
- **Key Classifications:**
  - **Level 1:** Inherited vs Customer-Provided vs Developer-Implemented
  - **Level 2:** Platform Engineering vs Software Development
  - **Level 3:** Technical specializations (Networking, Security Services, Application Layer, etc.)

### 2. Security Controls Analysis (✅ Ready)
**File:** `MVP Security - Scope Analysis - Draft Classifications - 2025-07-31.md`
- **Content:** 287 NIST 800-53 Rev 5 moderate baseline controls across 18 control families
- **Structure:** Organized by control family (AC, AU, SC, etc.) with implementation details
- **Key Data:** Control identifiers, names, baseline applicability, MVP requirements
- **Critical for:** Project Lion ATO compliance and security story generation

## Impact on Project Lion Development

The security requirements directly affect all Project Lion components:

### Component Security Mappings
- **Edge Connector:** Customer VPC isolation, IAM least privilege, encryption in transit
- **Ingestion Gateway:** JWT authentication, API rate limiting, audit logging
- **Metadata Catalog:** RBAC implementation, data classification, version control
- **Enrichment & Indexer:** Secure event processing, data validation, error handling
- **Search & Discovery:** Tenant isolation, field-level security, query auditing
- **Policy Engine:** OPA/Cedar integration, fine-grained access controls

### Development Process Integration
- Security controls mapped to BMad agent workflows
- User stories generated with security requirements embedded
- Sprint planning aligned with ATO milestone requirements
- Continuous compliance validation in CI/CD pipeline

## Security Controls Statistics

### Complete NIST 800-53 Rev 5 Analysis
- **Total Controls:** 287 security controls analyzed
- **Control Families:** 18 families (AC, AU, CA, CM, CP, IA, IR, MA, MP, PE, PL, PS, RA, SA, SC, SI, SR)
- **Moderate Baseline:** All 287 controls apply to moderate security baseline
- **Structure:** Organized by family with implementation details and BMad integration notes

### Key Control Families for Development
- **AC (Access Control):** 39 controls - Identity, authentication, authorization
- **AU (Audit and Accountability):** 16 controls - Logging, monitoring, audit trails  
- **SC (System and Communications Protection):** 25 controls - Encryption, boundary protection
- **IA (Identification and Authentication):** 24 controls - User/device authentication
- **CM (Configuration Management):** 24 controls - Baseline configs, change control

## BMad Agent Integration

Security requirements are now fully processed and available for:
- `/analyst` - Security requirements analysis and gap identification
- `/architect` - Security architecture validation against controls
- `/pm` - Security story prioritization and sprint planning
- `/dev` - Security control implementation in code
- `/qa` - Security testing and compliance validation

## Summary

✅ **Security Requirements Ingestion Complete**

Both security requirements documents have been successfully processed and are ready for BMad agent workflows:

1. **Classification Methodology:** Framework for organizing security controls by implementation responsibility
2. **NIST 800-53 Controls:** Complete analysis of 287 moderate baseline controls across 18 families

All files are available in `input-documents-converted-to-md/security-requirements/` for BMad agent processing and Project Lion ATO compliance implementation.
